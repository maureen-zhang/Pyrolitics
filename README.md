# Pyrolitics: A Study on Wildfire Impact Prediction with Electric Power Usage
A project by Maureen Zhang, Faycal Chaouqui, Marco Lopez, Malik Tuerkoen, Junhui Shi.

## Overview
- Introduce background on recent wildfire, on elctric companay, etc. Cite sources.
- This project does what ?..
- whats the result and implication
### Motivation:

### Stakeholders:
- Electricity companies: PG&E
- Smart Grid companies: General Electric, Siemens, etc.
- Governments & NGOs: FEMA, The Red Cross, USDA, IAFF, The Salvation Army, etc.
### KPI(s):
- Internal: Prediction Accuracy (MSE), Recall, Area Coverage(?). external: Burn Probability, Aggregate Fire Damage, Energy Efficiency, MTBF, SAIFI, etc.
### Objectives:
Construct a machine learning predictive model which estimates next season wildfire damage to civilian structures given electricity usages.
[Optional] Electricity/Power Usage Scheduling System to minimize wildfire risks or costs
### Duration: 
2 months [due 4/21].
