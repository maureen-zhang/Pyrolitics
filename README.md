# Pyrolitics: A Study on Wildfire Impact Prediction with Electric Power Usage
A project by Maureen Zhang, Faycal Chaouqui, Marco Lopez, Malik Tuerkoen, Junhui Shi.

## Overview
Wildfires and power grids share a complex, destructive relationshipâ€”wildfires damage electrical infrastructure, leading to significant repair costs and economic disruptions, while power lines themselves are a major ignition source for fires. In Southern California, where wildfire risk is high due to dry conditions, strong winds, and dense vegetation, understanding this relationship is critical.

Currently, government agencies and electricity companies face massive financial losses from fire-induced grid failures, legal liabilities, stock fluctuations, and fire victim compensation funds. However, these losses are often reactive rather than proactively mitigated. There is no existing predictive model that quantifies the full economic impact of wildfire-related power grid failures or guides infrastructure adjustments to minimize future risks.

This project aims to fill that gap by leveraging machine learning to analyze how wildfires and power grids interact, predict financial losses, and provide actionable insights for government agencies and electricity companies.

### Motivation:
By integrating wildfire data, power grid geography, electricity usage, stock prices, fire victim trust funds, and electricity revenue, this project delivers a data-driven approach to wildfire mitigation. By predicting financial losses and infrastructure risks, it empowers governments and electricity companies to minimize economic damage, enhance fire prevention, and optimize power grid resilience. The ultimate goal is to build a sustainable, cost-effective energy infrastructure in Southern California while mitigating the devastating impact of wildfires.

### Stakeholders:
- Electricity companies: PG&E
- Smart Grid companies: General Electric, Siemens, etc.
- Governments & NGOs: FEMA, The Red Cross, USDA, IAFF, The Salvation Army, etc.
### KPI(s):
- Internal: Prediction Accuracy (MSE), Recall, Area Coverage(?). external: Burn Probability, Aggregate Fire Damage, Energy Efficiency, MTBF, SAIFI, etc.
### Objectives:
Construct a machine learning predictive model which estimates next season wildfire damage to civilian structures given electricity usages.
[Optional] Electricity/Power Usage Scheduling System to minimize wildfire risks or costs
### Duration: 
2 months [due 4/21].
